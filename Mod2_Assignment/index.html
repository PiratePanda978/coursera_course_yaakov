First, we're going to style a paragraph tag, because we're going to use it as our visual kind of anchor, to see where the elements fall.

And here actually, I'm using this little trick, to center our paragraph tag inside a block level element, which is going to be a div. And the way to center it is to make sure the width is specified, and then to give it margin right auto, and margin left auto</p></section></div>
